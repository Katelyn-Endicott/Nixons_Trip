                Our project examines President Richard Nixon's Trip to China in February of 1972, an event so impactful that 
                it was coined as “the week that changed the world.” In our project, we hope to show the historical significance 
                of Nixon's visit, as well as the importance of the people involved—who they were, and how they influenced Nixon's 
                policy with China. We also will dive into the weeks leading up to his trip, Nixon's time in China, and the weeks after. 
                We are using the collection of the Nixon Recordings, which is hosted by the National Archives, to further our analysis 
                of Nixon's trip. Nixon's recordings have been scrutinized for decades, but the sheer volume of them means that there 
                is still a lot of ground left unexplored. The recordings are relevant to Nixon's trip to China as it features Nixon 
                discussing topics like the relations with China as well as the Vietnam war. The tapes also have metadata attached to 
                each recording which allows for further analysis regarding the participants in recordings, the timeline, and more. 
                President Nixon is often overshadowed by his abrupt and dramatic end as president, while his positive impact on 
                international relations is overlooked. In a time when peaceful interactions seemed near impossible, Nixon was one of 
                the few presidents that strived for diplomatic relations with China. Not only did Nixon want to improve relations
                with China, but he also wanted to find a way to end the Vietnam War. The US and China had not had relations since 
                1949, and Nixon saw improving those relations with China as the first step to ending the war. Nixon had a fine line 
                to walk as he didn't want to suppress Taiwan's Independence, but he also wanted to de-escalate tensions. Nixon made
                history as the first U.S. president to visit China; his trip lasted a week, from February 21st through the 28th. 
                That week allowed fundamental doors to be opened for future international relations. Simply put without Nixon, our
                history with China could look very different.
                <br><br>

              <p>

                There are multiple accounts of Nixon's trip, from books to interviews, which all heavily overlap, suggesting that 
                these accounts are reliable sources. The readings posit that the U.S. and China wanted to put an end to the conflicts 
                they were involved in around the world. They were also interested in repairing their relationship for their own 
                reasons; the U.S. wanted to get out of the Vietnam war and shift their focus inward, while China wanted to join the 
                global market and have an ally to aid them against any possible Soviet expansion. The journey to building that better 
                relationship between the two countries was neither short nor easy. There were multiple events that substantiated the
                idea that both countries were dedicated and wanted a better relationship with each other, from Nixon easing restrictions 
                on trade and travel with China, to China hosting a ping pong match against the US. All these events served to break 
                the ice and humanize each side, ultimately resulting in Henry Kissinger's secret visit to China, which in turn paved 
                the way for Nixon's highly publicized trip to China.

                This project is aimed at showing and analyzing the complexities of Nixon and his most trusted confidants, mostly 
                surrounding Nixon's trip to China and what came from it. In particular, we want to shift the focus towards some of 
                the slightly lesser-known figures involved; those not often included in the traditional historical narrative. 
                Who were they? What was their impact? Looking at the political climate in the US and the public's opinion of the 
                Vietnam war, we can understand the importance of Nixon's trip. This trip was the first step to ending the Vietnam War 
                and led to the Moscow peace summit of 1972. While this project aims to show the good that was done by Nixon, it also 
                will show some of the unknown factors and negative actions Nixon had done during his time in the White House. There 
                is still much to understand about Nixon, and we believe the collection of Nixon's recordings can help further that our 
                analysis of Nixon and his actions regarding China. Missing minutes and bleeped out sections of audio give room for you 
                to ponder on how much Nixon could have gotten away with if not for the Watergate investigation.

              Tensions where high between China and the United States before Nixons monumental trip in February 1972. The Vietnam war put Nixon in the spotlight as the nation waited to see how he would handle international relations. Before 1972, the last time for a president visited China was in 1949, when the Peoples Republic of China was established. After that no formal contact was held between leaders, once the Vietnam war began things became even more difficult. With public opinion focusing on the US involvement in Vietnam and the public beginning to lose trust in International relations, Nixon had to make a move. With the months leading up to the Presidents visit, small occurrences happened to allow this historic moment to happen. In 1971, USA and China’s Table Tennis teams met at a tournament, this was a huge step for both countries. Then as a gesture of peace the Chinese team suggested they come back over to Bejing to play table tennis. This was the step that allowed talks of possible communication, from then on, it was a domino effect to Nixons visit.

            <p> By examining who participated most in the conversations the month before the trip to China, 
              we can gain a deeper understanding of who might have had a significant influence in Nixon’s decisions 
              leading up to his trip to China. Not only does this provide an insight to who was involved but also who 
              the amount of conversations they were involved in with Nixon.

            <p>The Nixon recordings make up a truly massive sea of data, more than could ever be sifted through and understood. Across the tens of thousands of White House recordings, Richard Nixon is heard speaking to hundreds of different people—how do we know which recordings were important, which people were important? By filtering out the people he only spoke to a handful of times, we can create a list of the people he spoke to the most—the people who most influenced his decisions. We can then further shrink our dataset to include only the people who were recorded within a few weeks of Nixon’s China trip. This process gives us the names Henry Kissinger, H.R. Haldeman, and Stephen Bull.</p> 

<h4>Henry Kissinger: </h4> 

<ul> 

<li>Served as Secretary of State and National Security Advisor under Nixon. </li> 

<li> Visited China in 1971 to hash out details for Nixon’s trip. </li> 

<li> Was among the group of people who joined Nixon on his China trip. </li> 

</ul> 

<h4> Haldeman: </h4> 

<ul> 

<li> White House Chief of Staff; a stern taskmaster type. </li> 

<li> Was among the group of people who joined Nixon on his China trip. </li> 

<li> Very loyal to Nixon—was tried on counts of perjury, conspiracy, and obstruction of justice for his role in the Watergate cover-up, landing him in prison for 18 months. </li> 

</ul> 

<h4> Stephen Bull: </h4> 

<ul> 

<li> As Nixon’s personal aide, Stephen Bull was present for a lot of the White House recordings. </li> 

<li> He was less of a participant, and more of an observer; a fly on the wall in the oval office, bearing witness to a lot of historical events. </li> 

<li> Stephen Bull was present for the announcement of Nixon’s China trip, but did not accompany him on the actual trip. </li>

            <p>In the second excerpt, Nixon tries to explain that this China trip does not suddenly mean that China and America are on great terms now—rather, he wants to emphasize that they still have fundamental philosophical disagreements. What’s important, he says, is that these two powerful nations that hold the fate of billions in their hands can still come together and talk peacefully. </p>

          <p> Once it was finalized that President Nixon would be making the trip over to China, 
            the news was filled with positive political light. The hope seemed to rise, as this trip could 
            open up many doors for international relations for the US. Nixon visited many key places in China, 
            but his conversations with President Mao are the staple of the trip, this showed a bright future for 
            the country's relations. The overall trip wasn’t highly publicized, but the week still held its significance
            and was rightfully named “The Week that Changed the World”.  </p>

                  the Forbidden City, in which Zhou gave a guided tour to, which is a very important complex as it was the former Chinese imperial palace. </p>

            <p> By examining who participated most in the conversations the month after the trip to China, we can gain a deeper 
              understanding of who might have had a significant influence in Nixon’s decisions leading up to his trip to China. There
              was a shift in who participated in the most conversations from before the trip to after. Before, the key participants were
              Manolo Sanchez, Stephen B. Bull and H.R. Haldeman, and after we can see the key participants as the same few, but there are
              more smaller participants involved as well. This could have been due to Nixon's priorities shifting, or other participants
              gaining more influence in Nixon's Network.

              Henry Kissinger’s book “On China” is a significant point of view when examining the actors that were significant 
              in President Nixon’s trip to China. Kissinger played a crucial role in the diplomatic negotiations that led to the 
              trip. Kissinger himself not only went on his secret trip to China before, he also accompanied Nixon to China. As the 
              National Security Advisor and later Secretary of State, Kissinger played a key role in facilitating the first high-level 
              contacts between the US and China in more than two decades. 
              <br><br>
              “On China” provides a unique perspective on the US’s relationship with China, as well as Nixon’s accomplishments regarding China.
              Kissinger’s book deep dives into the complex relations between not only the US and China, but also other major influences around 
              the world and how it had developed over time. Kissinger also highlights the delicate situation that the US had between engaging with 
              China and not alienating Taiwan. 
              <br><br>
              Chapter 9 of the book is titled: “Resumption of Relations: First Encounters with Mao and Zhou.” This chapter focuses on the historic 
              meeting between President Richard Nixon and the Chinese leaders Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai in Beijing in 1972. This meeting marked the 
              resumption of diplomatic relations between the United States and China after more than two decades of tension. Kissinger also provides 
              a detailed account of the discussions that took place in China, highlighting how the leaders engaged with candor. Kissinger was able to 
              use his personal experiences and insights to offer a unique perspective on the events and dynamics that shaped US-China relations 
              during this critical period.
