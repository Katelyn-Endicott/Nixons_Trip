              Paragraph 1: Introduction. 
              <br><br>
                Our project examines President Richard Nixon's Trip to China in February of 1972, an event so impactful that 
                it was coined as “the week that changed the world.” In our project, we hope to show the historical significance 
                of Nixon's visit, as well as the importance of the people involved—who they were, and how they influenced Nixon's 
                policy with China. We also will dive into the weeks leading up to his trip, Nixon's time in China, and the weeks after. 
                We are using the collection of the Nixon Recordings, which is hosted by the National Archives, to further our analysis 
                of Nixon's trip. Nixon's recordings have been scrutinized for decades, but the sheer volume of them means that there 
                is still a lot of ground left unexplored. The recordings are relevant to Nixon's trip to China as it features Nixon 
                discussing topics like the relations with China as well as the Vietnam war. The tapes also have metadata attached to 
                each recording which allows for further analysis regarding the participants in recordings, the timeline, and more. 
                President Nixon is often overshadowed by his abrupt and dramatic end as president, while his positive impact on 
                international relations is overlooked. In a time when peaceful interactions seemed near impossible, Nixon was one of 
                the few presidents that strived for diplomatic relations with China. Not only did Nixon want to improve relations
                with China, but he also wanted to find a way to end the Vietnam War. The US and China had not had relations since 
                1949, and Nixon saw improving those relations with China as the first step to ending the war. Nixon had a fine line 
                to walk as he didn't want to suppress Taiwan's Independence, but he also wanted to de-escalate tensions. Nixon made
                history as the first U.S. president to visit China; his trip lasted a week, from February 21st through the 28th. 
                That week allowed fundamental doors to be opened for future international relations. Simply put without Nixon, our
                history with China could look very different.

                Paragraph 2: Place in the literature. 
                <br><br>
                There are multiple accounts of Nixon's trip, from books to interviews, which all heavily overlap, suggesting that 
                these accounts are reliable sources. The readings posit that the U.S. and China wanted to put an end to the conflicts 
                they were involved in around the world. They were also interested in repairing their relationship for their own 
                reasons; the U.S. wanted to get out of the Vietnam war and shift their focus inward, while China wanted to join the 
                global market and have an ally to aid them against any possible Soviet expansion. The journey to building that better 
                relationship between the two countries was neither short nor easy. There were multiple events that substantiated the
                idea that both countries were dedicated and wanted a better relationship with each other, from Nixon easing restrictions 
                on trade and travel with China, to China hosting a ping pong match against the US. All these events served to break 
                the ice and humanize each side, ultimately resulting in Henry Kissinger's secret visit to China, which in turn paved 
                the way for Nixon's highly publicized trip to China.

                Paragraph 3: Significance. 
                <br><br>
                This project is aimed at showing and analyzing the complexities of Nixon and his most trusted confidants, mostly 
                surrounding Nixon's trip to China and what came from it. In particular, we want to shift the focus towards some of 
                the slightly lesser-known figures involved; those not often included in the traditional historical narrative. 
                Who were they? What was their impact? Looking at the political climate in the US and the public's opinion of the 
                Vietnam war, we can understand the importance of Nixon's trip. This trip was the first step to ending the Vietnam War 
                and led to the Moscow peace summit of 1972. While this project aims to show the good that was done by Nixon, it also 
                will show some of the unknown factors and negative actions Nixon had done during his time in the White House. There 
                is still much to understand about Nixon, and we believe the collection of Nixon's recordings can help further that our 
                analysis of Nixon and his actions regarding China. Missing minutes and bleeped out sections of audio give room for you 
                to ponder on how much Nixon could have gotten away with if not for the Watergate investigation.

            <p>During President Nixons trip to China, he visited many important landmarks in China, this google maps visualization 
              allows us to see the expansive range of places he was able to visit. Using google maps, it gives a clear map of the 
              locations and provides a modern touch to the exploration of places. This visualization is important to our 
              understanding of Nixons trip as many of the details regarding what he accomplished while there are blurry, with 
              this map it shows how mobile and involved Nixon was during the visit. Allowing deeper conversations of his impact 
              on international relations.  </p>
