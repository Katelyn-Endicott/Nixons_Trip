<p>This project was made possible with the “White House Tapes of the Nixon Administration, 1971-1973" dataset, available here: </p><a href="https://www.archives.gov/open/nixon/37-wht-dataset-conversationlist.html ">Nixon Tapes</a>

<h3>Annotated Bibliography</h3>

<div>
    <p>We selected the White House Tapes of the Nixon Administration as our dataset. The White House tapes contain recordings of President Richard Nixon’s telephone calls and meetings taken in multiple places, from the White House’s Oval Office to conference rooms in China. The recordings came from recording devices placed in the various rooms per the request of President Nixon. The recordings span over two years, from February 16, 1971 to July 18, 1973.  </p> 

    <p>President Nixon was confident that the recordings would be his personal property and would remain in his custody after his administration was over. In 1973, the existence of the recordings was revealed to the public, which then lead to pressure to get the contents of the tapes released. Nixon was incredibly reluctant to give these recordings up to the public but was unsuccessful as pieces he couldn't cover up started to emerge. Nixon first released edited transcripts of the recordings, trying to make it seem as if he was complying, however the court quickly disregarded the transcripts and demanded the tapes. Most of the recordings were released to the public, yet some were kept private for personal reasons related to Nixon. Viewing the information, it's evident the exceptionally large amount of data there is to process; there are hours of audio recordings which are poor quality along with conversations that are often drawn out. Nevertheless, the recordings were transcribed, in which the physical recordings of the tapes were listened to many times over to accurately piece together the transcripts and metadata. </p> 

    <p>We are using the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA), Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum website. The data contains recordings of 22,723 conversations; organizing this much data is not easy, and we do not believe it is done perfectly here. The dataset provides many challenges, as it is difficult to find specific pieces of information when simply browsing, and it is easy to feel overwhelmed as it has a lot of data stored in various places. However, the NARA website provides multiple file formats of metadata about the recordings. The two file formats in which the metadata has been complied with are CSV as well as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). We will be able to use the metadata provided to create data visualizations in Tableau, which is a data visualization software. There is a data dictionary provided that outlines all the fields in the CSV file. The a few important fields are the date and time of the recordings, geographic coordinates, the participants of the conversations, and a brief description of the recording. </p> 

    <p>Figuring out what to do with this vast sea of information was our main challenge. There are many aspects to consider, like who, what, when, where and why these recordings are worth trying to understand. When considering what to do with this data we want to eventually create a better visualization of where and when these recordings were taking place. We also wanted to understand more about the participants in the recordings. Who was Nixon talking to, and about what? From the Watergate investigation we know that Nixon was not the most honorable or trustworthy leader. Who knows what else he would have done if Watergate had not occurred, and he were not caught. We would like to see this data presented in a way that shows the recording with specific people in them, recordings of specific events and places, topics, opinions. Having the information organized this way would make it much easier to navigate, understand and learn the importance of these events. </p> 

    <p>The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) goal is to archive as much history as possible for public use. Whether it be to prove heritage, family member(s) serving in the military, or researching a historical topic of interest, as they state as examples. NARA has 43 facilities in 17 states with 2,569 staff members where they keep all that is archived ranging from paper, artifacts, film, photographs, aerial images, maps/charts, Architectual/engineering drawings, and electronic records. We will be focusing on the electronic records. To be better suited for the public, the NARA uses plain language, as they call it, so that everyone can read and understand what they are reading. Some of the biases they could have are, not letting information out to the public that they deem unsafe or unlawful as stated in their explanation of what they do there is 1-3% of records that cannot be shown for important or legal reasons, or any information that the public would find interesting to get more publicity.  </p>

<p> Burr, William. Nixon's Trip to China. 11 December 2003. 30 January 2023. <https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB106/>. 

This article contains summaries of the memos taken during the 1972 China meetings. They show that the Nixon administration was interested in fostering a friendly relationship with China, by supporting China against Taiwan’s independence where possible, by offering information about Soviet military forces, and by promising to “restrain” Japan’s military expansion. 

William Burr is a senior analyst at the National Security Archive. Included in the article are scans of the original memos, making this source very reliable. </p>


<p>Burr, William, editor. The Beijing-Washington Back-Channel and Henry Kissinger’s Secret Trip to China. 27 Feb. 2002, nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB66.
This article is about the lead up to Kissinger’s secret trip to China, the topic of the meeting, and a little of the aftermath of the meeting. Where the US and China wanted to improve their relationship between each other. Where both countries benefit where the US can focus on internal struggles like the economy, and get of external conflicts like the Vietnam War, and China gets into the global economy as well as gets security with the US in case the Soviet Union tries to expand into China. Then Kissinger goes to China with Nixon expressing he wants Kissinger to ensure China that the US does not want a one Tiawan and one China or two Chinas solution. Which Kissinger then minimized the importance of length of that discussion when back in the US, but when it gets released in the US in creates trouble for Gerald Ford when he is president with keeping good reltionship with China but not frustrating the Republican party. </p>
 

<p>Burr, William, editor. New Documentary Reveals Secret U.S., Chinese Diplomacy Behind Nixon’s Trip. 21 Dec. 2004, nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB145/index.htm. 

This article is dedicated to a documentary that aired on December 21, 2004 called History Declassified: Nixon in China about Nixons trip to China and the new information that had been released decades later. The article provides a small summary of the documentary, showing that it's looking to release information that was meant to be kept classified. Throughout the summary it shows commentary by interviewees, claiming that the information released is shocking. The documentary also was the Winner of the 2005 Emmy Award for Outstanding Achievement in News & Documentary Research, which the article has written at the top of the page.  

William Burr is a senior analyst at the National security archive, his take on this documentary is well written and the sources he cited prove his facts come from a direct source. This article and the documents it contains is specific and allows for easy use in our research. I think the article is not as scholarly as we might need but it does provide useful insight. </p> 
 

<p>Burr, William, et al. NEGOTIATING U.S.-CHINESE RAPPROCHEMENT. 22 May 2002. 29 January 2023. <https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB70/>. 

This article covers Kissinger’s secret 1971 trip to China to meet with Zhou Enlai. The purpose of this meeting was to pin down the logistical details of Nixon’s 1972 trip, as well as discuss many of the same topics, including Taiwan, Japan, and the Vietnam war. They also drafted the “Shanghai Communiqué,” the diplomatic document that was eventually released after Nixon’s visit that detailed the U.S. and Chinese stances on various issues. Kissinger was interested in drafting a document that focused on what the two nations agreed on while gliding over disagreements, but Zhou was interested in drafting a more honest document that focused on both agreements and disagreements. This impressed Kissinger, who held a high opinion of Chinese leadership at the time. The article also mentions that “a growing body of scholarship in China and the United States draws upon Chinese language sources to show that Beijing was just as energetic as Washington in trying to signal interest in a new relationship.” 

As another William Burr National Security Archive document, this article is also very reliable and unbiased. It offers an important insight into the events leading up to Nixon’s 1972 visit. </p> 

 
<p>Hughes, Ken. NIXON’S FIRST WEEK OF TAPING: THE DECISION TO TAPE. n.d. 29 January 2023. <https://prde.upress.virginia.edu/content/nixon_first_week>. 

This article goes over Nixon’s decision to install a voice-activated taping system. The 5 previous presidents had had similar manual systems for the purpose of correcting the records of their meetings. Nixon did not foresee that they would be used to correct the record against him. During his presidency, Nixon did not draw on the recordings at all, he just continued to make them and store them away. 

This article was written by a specialist at the University of Virginia who works on the “presidential recordings program” that studies these tapes. It is written from a historian’s perspective, unaffiliated with the United States government, so it can be assumed to be relatively unbiased and quite reliable. </p> 


<p>Kissinger, Henry. On China. Reprint, Penguin Books, 2012. 

This book highlights the complex history of US and China’s relations over a vast period of time. While majority of the book provides an in-depth dive into China and their international affairs, a few chapters focus on Nixon’s trip to China, providing context for the meeting, and an understanding of the aftermath. Henry Kissinger had made a secret trip to China before Nixon, in an attempt to have the first dialogue with China. Seven months later, Nixon made the highly publicized trip to China but was underwhelmed by his welcome. As the Vietnam War was ongoing, the US and China had to both be very careful. Mao was avoiding many topics of discussion with Nixon but made sure to make clear China was not a threat to the US. Mao emphasized his desire for cooperation with the US in the future, even if talks ended in a deadlock on the trip. Nixon had not gone to China to push American principles onto the leaders of China, he sought to create stable international relations in a world filled with nuclear weapons. Nixon was able to achieve was few had done before, bringing about change in international affairs.   

As the book is written by Henry Kissinger, the former Secretary of State while Nixon was President, we must acknowledge the tremendous insights the book offers, along with potential biases. As Kissinger was an actor in the visit to China, as well in relations with China, he experienced it from his point of view. Although the book may present some biases, his experiences, opinion and understanding are tremendously relevant to our project.  

This book is a great addition to our resources for our project. It provides in-depth descriptions and explanations of the current US-China relations, as well as firsthand encounters of Nixon’s trip to China. This book will be key in developing our understanding of the trip, as well as comparing Kissinger’s opinions with other sources like official government documents; do they align? </p> 

 
<p>MacMillan, Margaret. Nixon and Mao: The Week That Changed the World. New York, United States, Penguin Random House, 2008. 

In this book, MacMillan focuses on Nixons past and his awareness for international affairs. The book explains the importance of Nixons trip going into detail of how secluded the US was from China for decades. Many small steps were taken to allow the two leaders to become comfortable enough to reach out and meet each other, including secret trips, messages through channels and even a national tournament in Bejing for table tennis. In this book Macmillan argues that Nixon was the very president to open the door for diplomatic relations between the US and China. MacMillan argues if Nixon had possibly still been in office for his full term, he would have been able to accomplish even more in regard to international relations.  

MacMillan centers herself into the timeframe, explaining thoroughly the importance of the events that occurred prior to the meeting. MacMillan explains she had to take an unbiased approach to be able to fully understand Nixons ways for the book. MacMillan does a wonderful job of setting the scene and explaining Nixons beginnings in international affairs, along with his friendship with Henry Kissinger. I believe this book is a reliable and somewhat current source, some new information has come out about Nixons trip to China but what the contents of this book presents are all still accurate. MacMillan is a decorated and well-trained historian, the book is very well placed for our research as it provides a specific set of facts but a general overview of other relationships. </p>

NIXON SECRET WHITE HOUSE RECORDINGS: COLLECTION SPECIFICATIONS. n.d. 30 January 2023. <https://millercenter.org/nixon-secret-white-house-recordings-collection-specifications#:~:text=From%20February%2016%2C%201971%2C%20through%20July%2012%2C%201973%2C,at%20the%20presidential%20retreat%20at%20Camp%20David%2C%20Maryland.>. 

This article touches on a lot of the technical issues that hindered the recording system. The tape system prioritized tape length and convenience over quality, which resulted in recordings that were almost unintelligible; they suffered from a generally low volume, lots of background noise, and portions of conversations simply going unrecorded.

<p>Nixon’s Trip to China. Nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB106/press.htm. 

This source provides a brief summary of Nixon’s trip to China. Nixon had made it clear on his trip in 1972 that although the U.S. would not suppress the Taiwan independence movement, they would not support it. It highlights that claim Henry Kissinger made that Taiwan was barely a topic in the conversations during the trip, was in contradiction to the documents released later.  

As this source is the National Security Archive, it is very reliable, and relaying the information released by the documents. This source provides a great summary of certain topics regarding the trip to China, but beyond does not have enough information in itself to be a substantial source. </p> 

 

<p>Luke A. Nichter, Nixontapes.org, Orange, California and Bowling Green, Ohio: National Security Archive, 2007 

nixontapes. Audio & Transcripts. n.d. 30 January 2023. <http://nixontapes.org/transcripts.html>. 

This site claims to be the only website dedicated solely to the scholarly production and dissemination of digitized Nixon tape audio and transcripts. It was made by a Professor at Chapman University, Luke A. Nichter, who has a focus on the "long 1960s" and has written multiple books regarding Nixon as well. This site has about 3000 hours of audio and has been posting even more as they are being released. An interesting part of this source is that the transcripts and audio are organized by person and by date and by specific events or topics.  </p> 

 

<p>New York Times Archived Articles and Times Machine 

The New York Times - Search. 8 Feb. 2023, www.nytimes.com/search?dropmab=false. 

The New York Times archive has thousands of articles in every year starting in 1851 until the present day. You can search what year, month or day to find the articles from that time. From 1968 to 1974 there were tons of articles with Nixon’s name front and center. Some I thought were interesting and helped understand what the public's view was then are. “NIXON SENDS COMBAT FORCES TO CAMBODIA TO DRIVE COMMUNISTS FROM STAGING ZONE”, May 1, 1970 , “Students at American U. Vote to Call Strike Today” May 1, 1970, when Nixon’s actions in Cambodia was taken very poorly by the public and others.” Kennedy Describes Action In Cambodia as ‘Madness’” May 2, 1970 “‘Selling of President’ Will Be Musical” Jan. 19, 1972, which is about how Nixon’s appearance was crafted by his political party in order to win.  

“Nixon's Visit to China Will Be Telecast Live”, Jan. 20, 1972. People understood now how Nixon uses events like this to gain popularity in attempting to win the reelection.  </p> 

 
<p>Pettigrew, Ryan. Nixon in China: Audiovisual Records from the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum. 16 February 2022. 29 January 2023. unwritten-record.blogs.archives.gov/2022/02/16/nixon-in-china-audiovisual-records-from-the-richard-nixon-presidential-library-and-museum. 

The significance of Nixon’s trip to China is highlighted by many factors. China and the US had not had relations since 1949, and the Vietnam War was still in progress. The US saw the meeting as “an easing of East-West hostilities,” and a step in the right direction towards the end of the war. The trip was a highly televised event, with over 100 hours of tape that is now preserved at the Nixon Presidental Library. The Nixon Library has numerous collections of film and audio sources of Nixon’s trip to China. 

This source is very reliable in terms of our project as it is on the National Archives Government website. Most of the sources and information in this website are audiovisual records from Nixons trip to China, and therefore is a reliable and relevant source to pull context and further information for our project. It will help provide an inside look at the trip through audio and video recordings. We can use the source to build upon our knowledge and supplement our project with mixed media. </p>

<p>Tudda, Chris. A Cold War Turning Point: Nixon and China, 1969-1972. Amsterdam, Netherlands, Amsterdam UP, 2012. 

This book talks about the lead up to the meeting and why Nixon wanted to meet with China. Being that building up the infrastructure fixing the economic decline America was facing with China’s fear of Soviet Military advancement into China as well as their want to join in the international marketplace. Which lead to Nixon easing travel and trade restrictions on China with China releasing prisoners. To then be about China inviting the American ping pong team over to China for a match. Then Kissinger’ secret visit to China to set the frame work for Nixon’s visit. The book uses some tapes of Nixon and calls of Kissinger. </p>
